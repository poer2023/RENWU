# Canvas Boundary Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented canvas boundary constraints and expanded the canvas area from 2000x2000 to 6000x6000 pixels (9x larger), ensuring all components scale appropriately.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Cleanup
- Identified 12 tasks with positions outside the canvas bounds
- Repositioned all out-of-bounds tasks to valid positions within the 2000x2000 canvas
- All tasks now have positions that respect the canvas boundaries

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### Modified Files:
- `frontend/src/composables/useTaskPositions.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/StickyCanvas.vue`
- `frontend/src/components/canvas/CanvasGrid.vue`

#### Key Features:
1. **Position Constraint Logic**:
   - Added boundary validation to `setTaskPosition()` function
   - Updated `getDefaultPosition()` to generate positions within bounds
   - Modified `setTaskPositions()` batch function to enforce constraints
   - Added validation during task initialization from database

2. **Canvas Size Constants** (Updated to 9x larger):
   - Canvas Width: 6000px (previously 2000px)
   - Canvas Height: 6000px (previously 2000px)
   - Task Card Width: 240px (default, unchanged)
   - Task Card Height: 120px (default, unchanged)
   - **Total Area**: 36,000,000 pixels (9x expansion)

3. **Drag System Integration**:
   - Updated drag move callbacks to apply boundary constraints in real-time
   - Modified drag end callbacks to ensure final positions are constrained
   - Added boundary checking to task creation functions

4. **Visual Boundary Indicator**:
   - Enhanced CanvasGrid component with boundary visualization
   - Added subtle border and background to show canvas limits
   - Boundary indicator is configurable and enabled by default

5. **MiniMap Navigation Updates**:
   - Updated MiniMap scaling calculations for 6000x6000 canvas
   - Removed artificial scale limitations to accommodate larger canvas
   - Ensured MiniMap viewport indicator accurately represents new canvas area
   - Scale ratio: ~0.02 (120x120 minimap representation of 6000x6000 canvas)

### 3. Boundary Logic
- Tasks cannot be positioned with negative x or y coordinates
- Tasks cannot extend beyond canvas width/height minus their dimensions
- Existing positions are validated and corrected on load
- New task creation respects canvas bounds
- Drag operations are constrained in real-time

### 4. Affected Operations
- **Task Dragging**: Positions are constrained during drag operations
- **Task Creation**: New tasks are positioned within bounds
- **AI Task Generation**: Batch task creation respects boundaries
- **Position Loading**: Database positions are validated and corrected
- **Auto-arrangement**: Layout functions work within canvas limits

## Technical Details

### Boundary Constraint Formula:
```javascript
constrainedX = Math.max(0, Math.min(x, CANVAS_WIDTH - TASK_WIDTH))
constrainedY = Math.max(0, Math.min(y, CANVAS_HEIGHT - TASK_HEIGHT))
```

### Canvas Bounds (Updated):
- Top-left: (0, 0)
- Bottom-right: (6000, 6000)
- Usable area for task positioning: (0, 0) to (5760, 5880) considering task dimensions
- **9x larger workspace** compared to previous 2000x2000 canvas

### MiniMap Integration:
- MiniMap dimensions: 160x120 pixels (unchanged)
- Canvas representation in MiniMap: 120x120 pixels (height-constrained)
- Scale factor: 0.02 (1 pixel in MiniMap = 50 pixels in canvas)
- Viewport indicator accurately shows current view within expanded canvas

## Benefits
1. **Expanded Workspace**: 9x larger canvas provides much more room for task organization
2. **Consistent User Experience**: All content remains within the visible/expected canvas area
3. **Visual Clarity**: Users can see the defined workspace boundaries
4. **Data Integrity**: Prevents impossible or invalid task positions
5. **Scalable Navigation**: MiniMap accurately represents the larger workspace
6. **Better Organization**: More space for complex project layouts and task hierarchies

## Verification
- ✅ All 17 existing tasks remain within the expanded 6000x6000 canvas bounds
- ✅ Boundary constraints are enforced across all task manipulation operations
- ✅ Visual boundary indicator correctly shows 6000x6000 canvas area
- ✅ MiniMap scaling accurately represents the expanded canvas (scale: 0.02)
- ✅ Real-time constraint validation during drag operations
- ✅ Canvas area successfully expanded from 4,000,000 to 36,000,000 pixels (9x increase)

## Update Summary
**Canvas Expansion**: 2000x2000 → 6000x6000 pixels
**Area Increase**: 4M → 36M pixels (9x larger)
**MiniMap Compatibility**: Maintained with automatic scaling
**Existing Tasks**: All remain valid within expanded boundaries
